          <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The project started focused on enhancing the Future of Civic's
            Program of Support (POS).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Survey Focus: Identifying Opportunities for our 12-week Program of
              Support.
            </li>
            <li>
              Purpose: Reframe the program by addressing pain points and
              unlocking opportunities.
            </li>

          </ul>
          <h2 class="major">User Research Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            As part of this phase, I considered the anatomy of an interview
            guide plus observation method.
          </p>

              alt="graphic showing different methods for empathy phase: feel, observe, and liste to"
          /></span>
          <p>Interviewed personas included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customers</li>
            <li>Families, carers, and guardians</li>
            <li>Employees</li>
          </ul>

          <span class="image fit"

              alt="image shows the methodology used for the user research"
          /></span>

          <h2 class="major">Main Insights</h2>
          <p>
            While talking to users and families, we realised that most of the
            problems were connected or related to lack of communication.
          </p>
          <span class="image fit"
            ><img
              src="images/folio4/13.jpg"
              alt="graphic showing different methods for empathy phase: feel, observe, and liste to"
          /></span>
          <span class="image fit"
            ><img
              src="images/folio4/15.jpg"
              alt="image shows the methodology used for the user research"
          /></span>
          <span class="image fit"
            ><img
              src="images/folio4/19.jpg"
              alt="image shows the methodology used for the user research"
          /></span>

          <h2 class="major">Addressing The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            After gathering and analysing all qualitative and quantitative data
            from the user research, we started to materialise our learnings and
            discoveries. At that moment, I was able to validate our problem
            statement, addressing specially the lack of communication.
          </p>
          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            After defining the challenges, we moved on to our ideation phase. To
            do this, we conducted rounds of idea generation, as well as using
            tools such as Crazy 8â€™s, allowing for the adaptation of ideas to a
            digital product context.
          </p>

          <h3>Sitemap and wireframe</h3>
          <p>
            The prioritised ideas were grouped into categories. These categories
            were then used to define the features that would be included in our
            wireframe and sitemap.
          </p>

              src="images/folio4/paper-prototype.jpeg"
              alt="Graphic shows a persona canvas used as an example for the project"
          /></span>

          <span class="image fit"
            ><img
              src="images/folio4/relume-sitemap.png"
              alt="Graphic shows a persona canvas used as an example for the project"
          /></span>
          <span class="image fit"

              alt="Graphic shows a persona canvas used as an example for the project"
          /></span>

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            These are the wireframes. The user flow allowed us to map which
            routes among the features were best for each audience in a fast and
            objective way.
          </p>

              alt="Graphic shows a persona canvas used as an example for the project"
          /></span>

          <h3>Look and Fell</h3>
          <p>
            From there we tested the low-fi wireframe and started applying the
            look and feel to the prototype, starting the User Interface phase.
            We used Material Design (Google) best practices to support this
            phase.
          </p>

              alt="Graphic shows a persona canvas used as an example for the project"
          /></span>

          <h3>Design System</h3>
          <p>
            A design system was set up to support the future of the application.
          </p>

              alt="Graphic shows a persona canvas used as an example for the project"
          /></span>
          <h3>High-Fi Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            From that we proceeded to the high-fidelity prototype phase on
            Figma.
          </p>

          <span class="image fit"

              alt="Design displaying the atomic design for Citadel app"
          /></span>

          <h3>Roadmap</h3>
          <p>
            This project is being build still. Since I left the business, I have
            no more information about the status of the project. However, it's
            the suggested roadmap for implementation.
          </p>

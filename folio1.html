            How might we connect and empower psychologists and patients in a
            simple way, while addressing the specific needs of each one?

          <h2 class="major">The Initial Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            How might we help Brazilians living abroad take care of their mental
            health without feeling disconnected from home? <br />
            How might we support psychologists in managing and growing their
            businesses while they focus on providing psychological care?
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">Current Scenario</h2>
          <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the adoption of virtual care
            solutions for mental health worldwide, with technologies like
            WhatsApp, FaceTime, and Zoom becoming essential tools for
            maintaining treatment. In Brazil, Resolution CFP nº 011/2018 paved
            the way for remote psychological counselling even before the
            pandemic. However, despite these advancements, over 3 million
            Brazilians living abroad, including a growing number of students,
            often face challenges accessing adequate mental health support. This
            underserved demographic highlights the need for targeted initiatives
            like this project, which aims to provide tailored mental health
            solutions for Brazilian students abroad, addressing their unique
            needs and contributing to their overall well-being and academic
            success.

          <h2 class="major">The Research</h2>
          <h3 class="major">Qualitative Research</h3>
          <p>
            To conduct qualitative research, we adopted the interview anatomy
            model, as shown below. <br />
            <br />This guide helped us explore stories based on past and real
            experiences, allowing the interviewee to relive those experiences
            and thus connect more deeply with us. That is, to feel what our user
            was feeling and achieve deeper empathy.
          </p>
          <span
            ><img
              class="image half-size"
              src="images/folio1/Anatomy-of-interview.png"
              alt="A graphic showing the phases for applying a qualitative research"

          <h3 class="major">Qualitative Research</h3>

              alt="A graphic showing data from quantitative research"
          /></span>
          <p>
            In addition to the above data, we identified that among the
            difficulties with online consultations, only technical issues (such
            as equipment quality or internet connection) and patients having
            difficulty with the technology are the most concerning. We
            discovered that other situations that are not problematic for
            professionals include scheduling, personal difficulty with the
            tools, and staying focused. On the other hand, the biggest
            challenges and concerns with remote consultations are the lack of
            privacy and building a relationship with new patients. Many agree
            that remote consultations do not replace in-person ones (62%), but
            they understand that it is very important (40%).
          </p>
          <span class="image fit"

              alt="A graphic showing data from quantitative research"
          /></span>
          <p>
            In addition to the data above, it is worth noting that among
            patients who do not have online consultations, 43% did not receive
            this proposal from the professional and 23% were unaware of online
            services. Of these patients, 31% are not interested in online
            consultations, while 69% are interested.

          <h2 class="major">The Solution</h2>
          <h3 class="major">Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            After defining the challenges, we moved on to our ideation phase. To
            do this, we conducted rounds of idea generation, as well as using
            tools such as Crazy 8’s, allowing for the adaptation of ideas to a
            digital product context, as shown in the images below.

          <h3 class="major">Evaluation Matrix</h3>
          <p>
            The prioritised ideas were grouped into categories: patients,
            psychologists, and the connection between them. These categories
            were then used to define the features that would be included in our
            first low-fidelity prototype.

          <h3 class="major">Prototyping</h3>
          <h3 class="major">Low-fidelity Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            Using Marvel, we conducted low-fidelity prototype testing with 12
            users. Below, you can see the flow we used to animate and test our
            ideas.
          </p>

              alt="wireframing for low-fidelity prototype "
          /></span>
          <p>
            This first round of testing showed us what we should keep, discard,
            improve, and include for the creation of wireframes.
          </p>
          <span class="image fit"

          <h3 class="major">Wireframing</h3>
          <p>
            These are the wireframes. The user flow allowed us to map which
            routes among the features were best for each audience in a fast and
            objective way.

          <h3 class="major">High-fidelity Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            We proceeded to the high-fidelity prototype phase. To do so, we
            began by creating the user flow of the app and the corresponding
            style guide, which would serve as a basis for building the prototype
            on Figma.

          <br />
          <h3 class="major">Color Palette</h3>
          <p>
            We selected high-impact and contrasting colours: blue and orange. We
            defined warm and cool tones, created differentiation elements, and
            established levels and hierarchies for buttons and texts.
            Additionally, we chose alert and success colours inspired by
            Bootstrap and opted for an open-source web framework for interface
            components, websites, and applications.
          </p>

          <h3 class="major">Typography</h3>
          <p>
            We chose Lato by Łukasz Dziedzic as the font, conveying modernity
            and being more objective and minimalist. Choosing a sans-serif font
            is important to promote character resizing without any distortion or
            illegibility. We also used the perfect fourth proportions to ensure
            balance and sobriety between the texts.

          <h3 class="major">Buttons</h3>
          <p>
            We used the main colours from the initially defined colour palette.
            Two styles of buttons were used, solid and ghost, creating a
            hierarchy between elements when presented together. Border radius
            was also used to convey lightness, modernity, and create a more
            pleasing layout.

          <h3 class="major">Forms and Fields</h3>
          <p>
            Text fields followed the same styles and used alert colours to
            indicate possible errors and successes, keeping the user informed of
            what was happening.

          <h3 class="major">Icons</h3>
          <p>
            Accessibility and icons are strong allies when it comes to users
            with mental disabilities and other reading difficulties. They convey
            credibility, accessibility, and a more modern layout.

          <h2 class="major">Conclusion and Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            After two weeks of the project, we achieved a surprising result and
            gained deep knowledge about the market, the problem, the users, and
            the solution. However, we understand that we have not finished here.
            We need to improve usability, have a clearer definition of what our
            MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is, go through some more iteration
            sprints, and look at basic business plan issues that go beyond a
            design project, such as financial analysis, pricing strategy, and
            business model, technological platform development, marketing
            planning, among others. As of the completion of this article, we
            held some meetings with market people interested in moving forward
            with the solution.

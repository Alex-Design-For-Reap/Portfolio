            How might we connect and empower psychologists and patients in a
            simple way, while addressing the specific needs of each one?

          <h2 class="major">The Initial Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            How might we help Brazilians living abroad take care of their mental
            health without feeling disconnected from home? <br />
            How might we support psychologists in managing and growing their
            businesses while they focus on providing psychological care?
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">Current Scenario</h2>
          <p>
            It’s not new that Health and Well-being are part of the United
            Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The topic of mental health
            has gained even more attention due to the global pandemic caused by
            COVID-19, placing it at the top of the priority list for most
            governments, especially due to the social isolation established by
            the majority of countries. This has accelerated the search for
            technologies that can help address the problem, such as virtual care
            or telemedicine. However, offering virtual care has been an option
            for professionals and companies for some time, with many
            professionals adopting the practice since the resolution CFP nº
            011/2018 came into effect in 2018, which made it possible to provide
            remote and real-time psychological counseling. The difference now is
            that this has gone from being an option to being the primary or only
            form of care. As a result, psychologists and patients had to quickly
            adapt to maintain their treatments, using technologies that were
            already a part of their lives, such as WhatsApp and FaceTime, as
            well as introducing others like Zoom, Hangout, or Whereby, which
            were suggested by both parties. According to a report by the
            Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, over 3 million Brazilians are
            living in other countries, considering all types of visas, such as
            for study, work, permanent residence, and citizenship, as these
            individuals do not lose their Brazilian citizenship. For our
            project, we decided to start with a more specific audience, which is
            Brazilian students living abroad, but not limiting our solution to
            this group. Research and reports from people show that these
            Brazilians living abroad have been underserved by both the country
            they currently reside in and Brazil. This happens because
            governments are focused on solving internal problems and
            prioritizing their citizens, while foreigners do not fit into either
            scenario. When we look at students, this number has reached 500,000
            and has been growing year after year. And when it comes to mental
            health issues, this number among this group is growing
            proportionally.

          <h3 class="major">Student</h3>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, there was Barbara, a 24-year-old student and
            exchange student in Sydney, Australia. She had never had online
            psychological consultations before. <br />
            <br />Every day she works and studies, but she is having difficulty
            with English, the primary language in Australia. As she is attached
            to her family but now lives with people she did not know before, she
            misses home and due to the COVID-19 context, she is worried about
            her visa and her job, resulting in several concerns amplified by
            social isolation. One day she decided to seek advice from friends
            and one of them gave her the contact of an Australian psychologist,
            but Barbara did not feel comfortable with the psychologist due to
            cultural differences. Because of this, she sought a way to be
            treated by Brazilian psychologists, regardless of the distance, and
            found a company that had created an application focused on solving
            this type of problem in a simple way, without bureaucracy, with a
            free initial experience, ease of payment, and interaction between
            psychologist and patient. <br />
            <br />
            Finally, Barbara found a psychologist who was from the same city as
            her, focused on the problems she is facing at the moment, and
            allowing her to focus on her mental health and move forward with her
            dreams.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Psychologist</h3>
          <p>
            Once upon a time there was Renata, a 32-year-old psychologist from
            São Paulo, Brazil, with 7 years of experience in the profession. She
            divides her professional life between working in the HR department
            of a company and seeing patients at her private practice in São
            Paulo. <br />
            <br />Every day Renata sees patients at a psychology clinic. One
            day, due to the COVID pandemic, she started seeing patients online.
            Before the pandemic, she only used her phone for regular
            communication, but with the pandemic, the clinic announced that all
            appointments must be conducted from home, respecting social
            distancing measures. Because Renata loves what she does and doesn’t
            want her patients to give up on their appointments, she looked for
            easier ways to conduct online sessions. That’s why she became
            increasingly focused on finding an app that could help her manage
            her appointments and promote her services to attract new clients.
            <br />
            <br />She found an app that not only allowed her to communicate with
            her patients but also enabled them to pay for her services in
            real-time. The app also allows her to manage her business and
            promote her personal brand, all on the same platform. This allows
            her to be 100% focused on what matters most to her: her patients.
            <br />
            brFinally, Renata is gaining new patients, managing her business
            more efficiently, and providing better care to her patients. To help
            define our users quickly and simply, we present below the story of
            each of them, based on the Pixar Storytelling technique.
          </p>
          <div>
            <h2 class="major">The Research</h2>
            <h3 class="major">Qualitative Research</h3>
            <p>
              To conduct qualitative research, we adopted the interview anatomy
              model, as shown below. <br />
              <br />This guide helped us explore stories based on past and real
              experiences, allowing the interviewee to relive those experiences
              and thus connect more deeply with us. That is, to feel what our
              user was feeling and achieve deeper empathy.
            </p>

            /></span>
            <h3 class="major">Qualitative Research</h3>
            <span class="image fit"

                alt="A graphic showing data from quantitative research"
            /></span>
            <p>
              In addition to the above data, we identified that among the
              difficulties with online consultations, only technical issues
              (such as equipment quality or internet connection) and patients
              having difficulty with the technology are the most concerning. We
              discovered that other situations that are not problematic for
              professionals include scheduling, personal difficulty with the
              tools, and staying focused. On the other hand, the biggest
              challenges and concerns with remote consultations are the lack of
              privacy and building a relationship with new patients. Many agree
              that remote consultations do not replace in-person ones (62%), but
              they understand that it is very important (40%).
            </p>
            <span class="image fit"
              ><img

                alt="A graphic showing data from quantitative research"
            /></span>
            <p>
              In addition to the data above, it is worth noting that among
              patients who do not have online consultations, 43% did not receive
              this proposal from the professional and 23% were unaware of online
              services. Of these patients, 31% are not interested in online
              consultations, while 69% are interested.
            </p>
            <h2 class="major">The Reframed Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              How might we assist international students in caring for their
              mental health without them feeling the distance from their
              homes?<br /><br />
              How might we support the management and growth of the business,
              allowing the psychologist to focus on what really matters: the
              psychological care of patients?
            </p>
            <h2 class="major">The Solution</h2>
            <h3 class="major">Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              After defining the challenges, we moved on to our ideation phase.
              To do this, we conducted rounds of idea generation, as well as
              using tools such as Crazy 8’s, allowing for the adaptation of
              ideas to a digital product context, as shown in the images below.

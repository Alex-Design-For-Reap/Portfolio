            How might we connect and empower psychologists and patients in a
            simple way, while addressing the specific needs of each one?

          <h2 class="major">The Initial Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            How might we help Brazilians living abroad take care of their mental
            health without feeling disconnected from home? <br />
            How might we support psychologists in managing and growing their
            businesses while they focus on providing psychological care?
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">Current Scenario</h2>
          <p>
            It’s not new that Health and Well-being are part of the United
            Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The topic of mental health
            has gained even more attention due to the global pandemic caused by
            COVID-19, placing it at the top of the priority list for most
            governments, especially due to the social isolation established by
            the majority of countries. This has accelerated the search for
            technologies that can help address the problem, such as virtual care
            or telemedicine. However, offering virtual care has been an option
            for professionals and companies for some time, with many
            professionals adopting the practice since the resolution CFP nº
            011/2018 came into effect in 2018, which made it possible to provide
            remote and real-time psychological counseling. The difference now is
            that this has gone from being an option to being the primary or only
            form of care. As a result, psychologists and patients had to quickly
            adapt to maintain their treatments, using technologies that were
            already a part of their lives, such as WhatsApp and FaceTime, as
            well as introducing others like Zoom, Hangout, or Whereby, which
            were suggested by both parties. According to a report by the
            Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, over 3 million Brazilians are
            living in other countries, considering all types of visas, such as
            for study, work, permanent residence, and citizenship, as these
            individuals do not lose their Brazilian citizenship. For our
            project, we decided to start with a more specific audience, which is
            Brazilian students living abroad, but not limiting our solution to
            this group. Research and reports from people show that these
            Brazilians living abroad have been underserved by both the country
            they currently reside in and Brazil. This happens because
            governments are focused on solving internal problems and
            prioritizing their citizens, while foreigners do not fit into either
            scenario. When we look at students, this number has reached 500,000
            and has been growing year after year. And when it comes to mental
            health issues, this number among this group is growing
            proportionally.

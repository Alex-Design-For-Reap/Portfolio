          <h2 class="major">The Citadel Business</h2>
          <p>
            Citadel is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for managing your
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. It allows customers
            to remove the complexity and easily create, manage and maintain
            resources whilst being audit-ready, highly secure and compliant with
            industry standards such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and CDR
            (Consumer Data Right).
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">Market Analysis</h2>

          <h2 class="major">The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            How might we make the accreditation process simpler, faster, and
            cheaper than it actually is, leaving customers to focus on what
            matters most: their business?
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">The Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            We've decided to set up and run a new business, following the best
            practices that startups have been using by applying the three lenses
            of innovation: desirability, viability, and feasibility.

          /></span>

          <h3 class="major">Desirability</h3>
          <p>
            I became aware of customer complaints during my time at DNX
            Solutions. If we want to address these complaints, a logical first
            step would be to listen to these customers and it was exactly what I
            did.
          </p>

              alt="graphic showing different methods for empathy phase: feel, observe, and liste to"
          /></span>
          <p>
            As part of this phase, I considered the anatomy of an interview
            guide.
          </p>
          <span class="image fit"

          /></span>
          <p>Interviewed personas included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Current customers: to address their experiences and identify
              opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Potential customers: to understand decision-making processes,
              concerns, and pain points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Partners: such as Auditors, ISVs, and Consulting firms, integral
              to project delivery.
            </li>
            <li>
              AWS: a crucial stakeholder for scaling up the product quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Employees: to gather insights on automation possibilities and
              project experiences.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="major">Data Analysis & Validations</h3>
          <p>
            After gathering and analysing all qualitative and quantitative data
            from market analysis and research phases, I started to materialise
            our learnings and discoveries.At that moment, I was able to complete
            our first design tools, such as personas and customer journeys, and
            validate our problem statement, which, fortunately, has changed
            nothing.
          </p>
          <p>At a high level, they are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>CEOs of startups and SMBs</li>
            <li>Technical Decision Makers</li>
            <li>Developers and Operators</li>
            <li>Partners: Auditors and ISVs</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="major">Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            How might we make the accreditation process simpler, faster, and
            cheaper than it actually is, leaving customers to focus on what
            matter most: their business?
          </p>

          <h2 class="major">Viability</h2>
          <p>
            For Citadel, a viable product means profitability aligned with our
            goals. After analysing FinTechs and HealthTechs, I prompted the team
            to develop our business model, focusing on key aspects like value
            proposition and target audience. We also created our product vision
            and canvas together.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Business Model Canvas</h3>
          <span class="image fit"
            ><img
              src="images/folio2/Business-model.png"
              alt="Graphic shows a business model canva used for the project"

          <h3 class="major">Product Vision</h3>

          <h3 class="major">Does / Does Not / It is / It is Not</h3>

              alt="Graphic shows a business model canva used for the project"
          /></span>

          <h2 class="major">Feasibility</h2>
          <p>
            On the feasibility side, we have analysed all the critical aspects
            of building the solutions we intended. However, as most of the
            solutions are already delivered by DNX Solutions, for instance, we
            knew it wouldn’t be a concern. The more in-depth analysis we made
            was related to AWS APIs as part of the solutions to create a cloud
            infrastructure in the AWS cloud without the need to access the AWS
            console for it.
          </p>
          <h2 class="major">The Citadel Design Process</h2>
          <h3 class="major">Lean Inception</h3>
          <p>
            I proposed running a Lean Inception Workshop for the team. This
            one-week workshop combines design thinking and lean startup
            principles to align people and define the minimum viable product
            (MVP). It guides the team through various steps and activities,
            covering business, UX, and technology aspects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Product Vision</li>
            <li>Product Is-Is Not-Does Not Do</li>
            <li>Persona</li>
            <li>Feature Brainstorm</li>
            <li>Tech, UX, and Business Review</li>
            <li>User Journeys</li>
            <li>Journeys and Features</li>
            <li>Sequencer</li>
            <li>MVP Canvas</li>
            <li>Showcase</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="image fit"
            ><img
              src="images/folio2/Lean-inception.png"
              alt="Graphic shows a lean inception agenda used for the project"
          /></span>
          <h3 class="major">Technical, Business & UX Review</h3>
          <p>
            We looked over the ideas on our Miro board. It was a chance to talk
            about the technical, business, and UX aspects of each feature. We
            clarified things and dealt with any disagreements or doubts that
            came up.
          </p>
          <span

          /></span>

          <h3 class="major">Sequencer</h3>
          <p>
            The sequencer assists in organising and viewing the features and the
            incremental validation of the product. There are rules to follow
            that helped me to ensure we are building our product sprints in the
            right way
          </p>
          <span

          /></span>

          <h3 class="major">MVP Canvas</h3>
          <p>
            MVP Canvas is a visual chart that helps the team to align and define
            the MVP, the simplest version of the product that can be made
            available to the business (minimum product) and that can be
            effectively used and validated by the end user (viable product).
          </p>
          <span
            ><img
              class="image half-size"

          /></span>

          <h2 class="major">The Ongoing Process</h2>
          <p>
            The ongoing process is set up, and I began organising the design
            steps. Key aspects include user flows, prototyping, and handing off
            to the product team.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Upstream process</h3>
          <p>
            Everything I explained until this point is considered upstream
            projects/processes. The name is because I was more focused on
            discoveries and validations and it’s the precursor to the product
            (development team).
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            To finalise the upstream phase, based on the features sequencer we
            created in the Lean Inception Workshop, I start to create the user
            flow for each feature, see examples below.
          </p>

          /></span>
          <h3 class="major">Prototyping & Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            After validating the user flow, I created the prototype on Figma.
            This was tested with customers for improvement, marking the
            iteration process. View prototype examples in Figma.
          </p>

          /></span>
          <h3 class="major">Downstream Process</h3>
          <p>
            Features approved by the user? Time to build it. I use ClickUp to
            hand over tasks to the developers. They're familiar with the plan
            from the Lean Inception Workshop, which simplifies things for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            We followed sprints and had daily syncs to track progress and
            commitments. After each sprint, we used the sequencer to plan the
            next set of features. While developers built and released features,
            I focused on generating new ones for later development. This was our
            continuous product design and development process.

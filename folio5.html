          <h2 class="major">Kick-off Meeting</h2>
          <p>
            This case study will describe process I use while working on a
            website design project. The first phase is the kick-off where we
            determine the primary goals of the project. For Education Downunder
            we defined the two main goals below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enhance user experience, and provide comprehensive support to the
              student.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organise content: Structure the website's information hierarchy
              logically.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="major">Market Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            In analyzing competitors for our website project, I rely on desk
            research to explore their websites, content strategies, and digital
            presence. By examining design elements, content quality, and online
            metrics, we gain valuable insights to refine our strategy, improve
            user engagement, and stand out in the market.
          </p>
          <h3>Main competitors:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>https://tagarela.com.au/</li>
            <li>https://connectionflow.com.au/</li>
            <li>http://www.tripstudy.com.br/home</li>
            <li>https://onewayintercambio.com.br/</li>
            <li>https://www.gostudy.com.au/</li>

          </ul>
          <h2 class="major">Information Structure and Sitemap</h2>
          <p>
            I leverage Relume to streamline the creation of wireframes and
            sitemaps for my website projects. With its intuitive interface and
            robust features, Relume allows me to quickly sketch out the layout
            and structure of web pages, ensuring clarity and coherence in
            design. Its collaborative tools facilitate seamless communication
            with team members, enabling efficient brainstorming and iteration.
            By utilizing Relume's capabilities, I am able to visualize the user
            journey, optimize navigation flow, and ensure alignment with project
            objectives, resulting in more effective and user-friendly website
            designs.
          </p>

          <h2 class="major">Wireframe</h2>
          <p>
            The low-fidelity wireframe phase involves creating basic, simplified
            representations of web page layouts and structures. These wireframes
            typically use simple shapes, placeholders, and minimal detail to
            outline the fundamental elements and content arrangement without
            focusing on visual aesthetics. Low-fidelity wireframes serve as a
            blueprint for the website's layout, allowing for quick iteration and
            refinement of the overall design before investing significant time
            and resources into high-fidelity prototypes. By focusing on
            functionality and layout early in the design process, low-fidelity
            wireframes help identify potential usability issues, clarify user
            flow, and ensure alignment with project objectives.
          </p>

              alt="Image shows a wireframe built using Relume platform"
          /></span>

          <h2 class="major">Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>
            This phase helps identify any usability issues, navigation problems,
            or areas for improvement in the design before moving on to
            higher-fidelity prototypes or development. By incorporating
            usability testing early in the design process, teams can ensure that
            the final product meets the needs and expectations of its intended
            users, leading to a more successful and satisfying user experience.

              alt="Image shows a person doing a usability testing exercise"
          /></span>
          <h2 class="major">Validating structure and building content</h2>
          <p>
            After user testing, we finalize the website structure based on
            feedback. Then, we begin crafting content for each page, ensuring it
            aligns with the design and user needs. This step ensures a cohesive
            and engaging online experience. This is the final page structure
            that was used for desiging and building the website.
          </p>

          /></span>
          <h2 class="major">Style Guide, User Interface, and Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            The next phase involves creating a style guide and refining the user
            interface (UI). The style guide establishes consistent visual
            elements such as colors, typography, and iconography to maintain
            brand identity across the website. It also outlines UI components
            and their usage, ensuring uniformity and coherence in design.
            Meanwhile, UI refinement focuses on enhancing the visual appeal and
            usability of the interface based on feedback and best practices.
            This phase ensures a polished and cohesive look for the website
            while maintaining usability and brand consistency.
          </p>

              alt="Image shows a style guide used for the website"
          /></span>
          <h3 class="major">High-Fi User Interface</h3>
          <p>
            The process of building the user interface involves multiple
            iterations of feedback and improvement. It begins with initial
            designs based on project requirements and stakeholder input. These
            designs are then tested with users to gather feedback on usability,
            clarity, and effectiveness. Based on this feedback, the UI is
            refined and improved, incorporating suggestions and addressing any
            identified issues. This iterative cycle continues until the UI meets
            the desired standards of usability, aesthetics, and functionality.
            Each loop of feedback and improvement ensures that the final user
            interface is intuitive, visually appealing, and optimally serves the
            needs of its users.

          /></span>
          <h3 class="major">Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure our website adheres to accessibility standards, we
            meticulously test it against guidelines like WCAG and other
            pertinent standards. This entails assessing various facets such as
            text alternatives for non-text content, keyboard operability, color
            contrast, navigational logic, form accessibility, media inclusivity,
            responsive design, and compatibility with assistive technologies. By
            conducting rigorous testing, we ensure that our website is
            accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or assistive
            technology requirements.
